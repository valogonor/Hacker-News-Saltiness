If you feel like your meeting are wasting time, then maybe you&#x27;re just not managing your meetings well enough. Or maybe it&#x27;s because it&#x27;s not all about you.

And if you&#x27;re not daily spending 15 to 30 minutes testing the water with a: &quot;What did you plan to do yesterday? What did you actually end up doing? What do you plan to do today?&quot; then you&#x27;re likely blowing a lot more than the 15-30 minutes * N Developers with people floundering, getting tunnel vision, people who need a helping hand, maybe just need a break, making sure Bob is aware of the utility classes Tammy just developed so he doesn&#x27;t go off duplicating effort, etc.<p>It&#x27;s about fostering communication. It doesn&#x27;t happen by accident. If you find it&#x27;s happening and effective without the meeting then by all means re-evaluate. But don&#x27;t do that before you actually have the data to prove that. Because the risk is much greater than the cost.<p>And managing risk is what it&#x27;s all about. You do that right, and your odds of success go up ten fold. That doesn&#x27;t mean don&#x27;t try anything new either. It means weigh your options. Timebox.

I\\'m not sure why this was voted down.<p>The reason is that the border rank of 2x2 matrix multiplication is seven. This was proved 5 years ago by Landsberg, though it took quite some effort for me to track this down. Sometimes \"yes\" is the best one can do at short notice. Perhaps individuals who enjoy taking points away from people might consider this!<p>However, Winograd\\'s algorithm can do nxn matrix multiplication with n^3/2 + 2n^2 multiplications (and many more additions than usual). This is only useful if the coefficients are <i>very</i> large because of the cost of the extra additions. Moreover, this is not a block algorithm, i.e. it cannot be applied recursively. Anyhow, for 2x2 matrices, n = 2 and so the total number of multiplications is 2^3/2 + 2n^2 = 12 which is more than the usual 8 multiplications (or 7 if you use Strassen). Similarly for n = 3 it is less efficient than the naive 27 multiplications (and even less efficient than Lederman\\'s algorithm: 23 multiplications and Bard\\'s algorithm: 22 multiplications), but for n = 4 we get 4^3/2 + 2x4^2 = 64 which is the same as the naive algorithm and for n = 6 we get 6^3/2 + 2x6^2 = 180 which is well under the usual 216 multiplications required by the naive algorithm and even less than the number of multiplications required if you use one level of Strassen. Already by n = 8 Strassen is better if you go by the number of multiplications alone. Of course in practice the coefficients need to be really large (perhaps tens of machine words) before either Winograd or Strassen are better than the naive algorithm.<p>Note that if you break a larger matrix up into 2x2, i.e. 4 blocks then the smaller submatrices no longer commute (matrix multiplication is not commutative). This is why Winograd\\'s algorithm is not a block algorithm like the Strassen method.',\n",

This would allow an eight inch wafer to be packaged with minimal additional steps. Furthermore, this would have been an asyncronous processor design.

       "  220: '&gt; It can blink LEDs as well of course over GPIO but my impression is that this is a bit more complicated and requires extra hardware<p>Not really; all you need is an LED and some way of connecting it to pins on the J8 header. On the software side, working with GPIO (at least in Raspbian) is as easy as I&#x27;ve ever seen any implementation make it; with a couple of commands, you can expose an arbitrary set of GPIO pins as sysfs virtual files. From there, you can drive them with any scripting language, including shell, or even directly at the CLI with &quot;echo&quot; and &quot;cat&quot;.<p>This is what makes the Pi such an excellent platform for prototyping hardware to be implemented later on a smaller, more fit-for-purpose MCU: the &quot;time to first blinkenlight&quot; is extremely short, and iteration from there to standalone finished device can be quite granular.<p>To pick a handy example off my breadboard, here&#x27;s how you might take a four-digit seven-segment LED display (like a digital clock display), salvaged from a dead NordicTrack treadmill, through that process:<p>1. Identify LED display pins through experiment\\n-- The display turns out to be a rather typical common-cathode 4-digit display, with a partial 5th &quot;digit&quot; controlling the colon and decimals).<p>2. Wire up the LED display to the Pi&#x27;s J8 header, so that it can be driven by GPIOs\\n-- My breadboard [1] has a Pi bolted to it and interfaced via a homemade breakout, but you really don&#x27;t have to get that fancy; a pack of female-to-female jumpers [2] will amply suffice.<p>3. Expose the connected GPIOs via sysfs [3]\\n-- Once done, you can control them via shell scripts if you want, and many do.<p>4. Hack up a quick prototype in a scripting language, using the sysfs interface to control the connected device\\n-- In this project&#x27;s case, I found that, since the LED is common-cathode and has to be scanned in order to show different values on each digit, Perl + sysfs was too slow for proper flicker-free display.<p>5. Translate the prototype script into a proof-of-concept C program using a native library rather than the sysfs interface to drive the GPIOs\\n-- I use Mike McCauley&#x27;s lbcm2835 [4]; there are other options, which probably work just as well, but I found this one to best combine light weight (i.e. WiringPi wants to install binaries in my $PATH by default, and I don&#x27;t want that) and comprehensive exposure of the chip&#x27;s features.<p>6. Translate the C proof of concept into an equivalent implementation running on a microcontroller\\n-- When I get around to that step, I&#x27;ll be doing it on an MSP430, via the TI Launchpad which you can see below the Pi in the breadboard photo. Once I have a reliable clock driver running on the MCU, it&#x27;ll be time for the next step:<p>7. Modify the MCU firmware so that, instead of generating a clock display, it listens for commands via I2C and renders the received values on the LCD display\\n-- The BCM2835 can do I2C in hardware, and the Pi exposes it on J8. That&#x27;ll make this task a lot easier; instead of having to bit-bang I2C on GPIO pins, I can use the hardware functionality (exposed by lbcm2835) and concentrate on the MCU-side client implementation.\\n-- This&#x27;ll also free up a lot of GPIO pins on my Pi!<p>8. Move the finished design from breadboard to PCB\\n-- I&#x27;ll probably just solder this up on protoboard instead of having a proper PCB made, because one step remains:<p>9. Write MSP430 firmware that uses Mecrimus-B [5] to expose a USB device interface for receiving commands from a USB host, and acts as an I2C master to drive the LED display\\n-- The MSP doesn&#x27;t have a lot of firmware space, and Mecrimus-B takes up quite a bit of it; also, it&#x27;s written in assembly, not C. Instead of trying to intertwine the LED display driver with the USB stack, it&#x27;ll be easier just to run the USB stack on on MSP and the LED driver on another, interfaced via I2C, and MSP430s are cheap enough at ~$2.50&#x2F;ea that using two instead of one doesn&#x27;t drive the BOM up significantly for a one-off project.<p>As you can see, the Pi&#x27;s hardware, and the library support available for it, results in a reasonably smooth effort-and-difficulty gradient throughout the process. More to the point, almost every step produces an immediately usable artifact, which is great for a self-paced teaching project, both to maintain motivation and to allow for auto-titration to level of interest.<p>If I&#x27;m reading the Micro:Bit right, it provides something similar, but with an even shorter &quot;time to first blinkenlight&quot; -- instead of needing a basic understanding of the Unix shell and the nous to wire up an LED, you just plug the Micro:Bit (and its onboard LED matrix) into a computer, load up the web IDE, and you&#x27;re off and scampering.<p>[1] <a href=\"http:&#x2F;&#x2F;i.imgur.com&#x2F;SFTdBMt.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;i.imgur.com&#x2F;SFTdBMt.jpg</a>\\n[2] <a href=\"http:&#x2F;&#x2F;amzn.to&#x2F;1S65zoU\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;amzn.to&#x2F;1S65zoU</a>\\n[3] <a href=\"http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.auctoris.co.uk&#x2F;2012&#x2F;07&#x2F;19&#x2F;gpio-with-sysfs-on-a-raspberry-pi&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.auctoris.co.uk&#x2F;2012&#x2F;07&#x2F;19&#x2F;gpio-with-sysfs-on-a-ra...</a>\\n[4] <a href=\"http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.airspayce.com&#x2F;mikem&#x2F;bcm2835&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.airspayce.com&#x2F;mikem&#x2F;bcm2835&#x2F;</a>\\n[5] <a href=\"http:&#x2F;&#x2F;mecrisp.sourceforge.net&#x2F;mecrimus-b.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;mecrisp.sourceforge.net&#x2F;mecrimus-b.htm</a>',\n",

I&#x27;m happy to focus on this part if you like, but I&#x27;ll do so at the end.<p>===<p>&gt; &quot;CEO Stuff&quot;<p>There are different levels of responsibility and accountability.  A CEO, male or female, has legal obligations.  Your argument is that women with means have a moral obligation to stop harassment if there is little or no risk to them, otherwise they&#x27;re complicit.  Moral obligations are different than legal obligations for many reasons, but specifically in our discussion, a moral obligation implies responsibility for the situation.  I think you agree because you argue that women who don&#x27;t stop harassment in these cases are &quot;part of the problem&quot;.  I disagree entirely.  Nothing a woman could do would make them &quot;part of the problem&quot;, because the problem is male behavior.  By definition, women are excluded.<p>&gt;&gt; But I&#x27;ll also ask you: do you think men are frequently retaliated against for speaking up about the harassment of women? Is this really something I should have to find evidence to dispel?<p>&gt; Probably not, but that&#x27;s because <i>nobody</i> reports the harassment of others to the extent that they should. The victims have to file, and then they get retaliated against.<p>&gt; I don&#x27;t think you have shown sufficient evidence that women reporting the harassment of others are punished heavily, and also that they are disproportionately punished compared to men.<p>&gt; I seriously have no idea if men are punished as much. I want to know. I would expect a slight bias but for all I know men are 50x as able to report harassment without being retaliated against. But it needs evidence.<p>There is tons and tons of evidence showing that sexual harassment is primarily a problem with men sexually harassing women.  This article is well cited: <a href=\"http://www.nwlc.org/resource/fatima-goss-graves-testifies-eeoc-preventing-and-addressing-workplace-sexual-harassment\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.nwlc.org&#x2F;resource&#x2F;fatima-goss-graves-testifies-ee...</a>.  Some choice bits:<p>* Women account for over 82% of sexual harassment charges that make it to the EEOC<p>* 1 in 4 women have experienced sexual harassment in the workplace (at least once).<p>* Of those 18 million women, 70% of them did not report it.<p>* In contrast, 1 in 10 men have experienced sexual harassment in the workplace.<p>* Two-thirds of [low-wage] women workers felt they would face negative repercussions if they complained about or reported sexual harassment from management.<p>* 46 percent [low-wage] felt there would be negative repercussions if they complained about or reported sexual harassment from co-workers.<p>* 70 percent [low-wage] felt there would be negative repercussions if they complained about or reported sexual harassment from customers.<p>* A significant majority of women workers felt they would experience negative consequences, including financial loss, public humiliation, or job termination if they tried to report sexual harassment from management and customers.<p>Additionally, although not perfectly topical, this article finds that &quot;62 percent of [military] women who reported an assault said they experienced retaliation&quot;: <a href=\"http://www.nwlc.org/press-release/dod-report-shows-continued-high-numbers-sexual-assault-survivors-and-continued-retalia\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.nwlc.org&#x2F;press-release&#x2F;dod-report-shows-continued...</a><p>Granted these aren&#x27;t stats about men or women experiencing retaliation in your cooked up, mythical scenario.  But if you&#x27;re going to ignore all these statistics because your friendly neighborhood feminist ally (that&#x27;s me) couldn&#x27;t dig up exactly the stat you wanted, you&#x27;re planting your head firmly and deeply in the sand.<p>===<p>&gt; Victims get punished for reporting harassment, and that&#x27;s terrible, and that&#x27;s mostly women, but it has absolutely nothing to do with a discussion of how everyone around the harassment should act. Because in a group of 20 people, even if all the women get harassed once, they&#x27;re the bystander 90% of the time.<p>I feel like this is the crux of our argument.  You believe &quot;bystanders&quot;, male or not, are obligated to step in and stop harassment according to their relative power.  They&#x27;re not; women are not obligated to do this.  It&#x27;s not their fault someone is being harassed, they&#x27;re not responsible for the patriarchy.  Women are retaliated against heavily, and they already start at a disadvantage.  They are under no obligation to subject themselves to further, disproportionate hardship to fix a problem they have nothing to do with.<p>I&#x27;ve made several points in that paragraph, and I&#x27;m interested which ones you disagree with:<p>* Do you disagree that it&#x27;s not women&#x27;s fault someone is being harassed?<p>* Do you disagree that women are not responsible for the patriarchy?<p>* Do you disagree that women are far more likely to suffer the effects of retaliation compared to men, because they&#x27;re far more likely to experience harassment?<p>* Do you disagree that women start from a point of disadvantage compared to men, and therefore are not obligated to spend their hard-won resources fixing a problem that isn&#x27;t their fault and that has already disadvantaged them, especially when they can&#x27;t guarantee that something bad won&#x27;t happen to them?<p>I might be biased, but I find it hard to disagree with any of those points.<p>===<p>OK, now I&#x27;m ready to talk about even vs. uneven responsibility.<p>Your argument hinges on the idea that if you can do something, anything, about a problem, at little to no risk to yourself, you have a moral obligation to do so.  In this instance, even though women may not be able to do <i></i>as much<i></i> as men about harassment, the fact that they can do <i></i>something<i></i> morally obligates them.  I have multiple counterarguments.<p>1. Having the means to solve a problem in no way morally obligates you to do something about it.  I have something like $5,000 in a savings account.  With that money, I could buy a lot of soup for hungry people.  I am under no moral obligation to do this.  Very few people in society think this, because while hunger persists, almost everyone else has savings.  There are multiple problems I can work on with this money.  Why should I spend it on soup when I could donate it to mosquito nets?  Why should women use their resources against sexual harassment when they could put it towards reproductive rights, or a new set of tires for their car, or whatever they want because it&#x27;s their money?<p>2. No one is morally obligated to solve a problem for which they are not responsible.  I am not obligated to try and stop ISIS, for example.  I bear no responsibility for ISIS&#x27; actions.  Could I do something?  Sure.  I could donate to a charity.  I could fly to Baghdad and sign up as a resistance fighter (would they say no?  I don&#x27;t know).  The fact that I am doing nothing does not make me &quot;part of the problem&quot;.  Why does bad behavior on ISIS&#x27; part constitute some kind of obligation to stop them on mine?  Why am I a part of the ISIS problem in your eyes because I&#x27;m not on a plane to Baghdad right now?<p>3. You can never fully ascertain risk, especially in these circumstances.  We&#x27;re not talking about a moon landing here, we&#x27;re talking about volatile, unpredictable human behavior.  This isn&#x27;t hypothetical; women sometimes experience violent repercussions when confronting harassment.  Therefore, a major pillar of your argument (&quot;at little to no risk to yourself&quot;) falls.<p>4. It is grossly entitled for a system that oppresses women to ask women for support so it can stop oppressing them, labeling them as &quot;part of the problem&quot; if they refuse.<p>5. Given the current situation, which simplified could be characterized as men having $10,000 to solve a problem and Women have $7,500 to solve a problem because the problem has already cost women $2,500, why are women obligated to spend any money at all to fix the problem?  Hasn&#x27;t the problem cost them enough already?',\n",

There is a large difference between MBA, and getting something like Masters in Finance.</i><p>First of all, the top-tier programs aren't all the same. The University of Chicago MBA program, for instance, is widely considered finance-centric since it has a relatively low number of required core courses, so a student can (and many do) choose a curriculum that is very finance heavy and will end up with a better finance education than most people with straight finance degrees. However, you could end up pigeon-holing yourself in the same way you would with a straight finance degree, and this is a common reason for someone deciding against University of Chicago, especially if they already have a strong finance background.<p>The fact is that someone with an MBA in finance will be better equipped for pretty much any senior position than someone with a straight finance degree. There are plenty of people who can do finance, there's even probably an oversupply right now, but senior finance positions typically require a lot more than sitting in your office generating reports, which is what you'll likely end up doing with a finance degree. The fact is that a whole lot of people with straight finance degrees never learn the range of skills needed to run a business.<p>In fact, the value of MBAs has been made more obvious during the recent crisis in every business I'm familiar with (mostly private financial firms or web-oriented companies).

This suggests that he\\'s plenty capable of enduring the now-600 kN of force from his legs that he needs to jump to the top of a 120m building. It still takes him about a meter to do it, and he now produces 6 MPa of pressure on the ground -- less if his feet are much larger, but again he might jump from the balls of his feet, decreasing their surface area.<p>The only surprising thing is that he goes from 0 to 120 mph in at most two meters of pushing (assuming he somehow ducks down to the point where his center of mass is only 2ft above the ground -- that makes this an upper limit).

But my experience--and I&#x27;ve written plenty of Go, though I find it unpleasant to write and think about for all the usual reasons that Go partisans roll their eyes and so would rather deal with it as artifacts rather than actually writing it--has led to watching lots of developers make mudball codebases in the process (while blogging very heavily about how great it is three weeks in, and less a year-plus in). A pursuit of faux-simplicity has led to what I see as reinventing a lot of Java-1.4-era (because the language itself is essentially that) design patterns--and we should be reminded that design patterns exist to address defects in tooling--that more expressive languages have managed to avoid; the general desire for smaller applications helps to some extent, but software has this tendency to grow that I don&#x27;t think Go gives you the tools to effectively manage and maintain. Reasonable minds can differ, of course.<p>Past that, while I think it&#x27;s an alright choice for company-internal deployable products--web servers, worker nodes, etc.--I have straight-up problems with it being the new devops tool of choice.

Their original API does exactly what she's asking for: it let's you use Facebook's friend data, among other things, on your own external sites. This new version still does that, but it also allows you to embed your application inside of Facebook, as well as add data from your application, like Twitter updates, to people's profiles. If you don't want to embed your app inside of Facebook, you don't have to.<p>Facebook has added features that make it far easier to find and use external applications based on the API, but for some reason people think that's a bad thing? I don't get it. Yeah, if your app relies heavily on Facebook you'll be locked in, but every other API has that same effect. It's the nature of the beast.<p>I think the reason why this is throwing people off is because Facebook really isn't a discrete application itself. When you use the Google Maps API, you're building on top of that map and embedding it directly into the page. You basically get everything Google was already offering in that widget. With the Flickr API, you get to do neat things with pictures, and put those in your pages. With Facebook, what would you be embedding? At its most basic level, Facebook is the friend graph, with all sorts of other things piled on top of it. Most of what you care about is who is friends with who, and it's harder to visualize that than it is with most other sites out there that offer APIs.<p>But anyway, they didn't get it backwards. They made the API more valuable to third party developers by integrating it into the site more, while still giving you the freedom to have your entire site live outside of Facebook. In turn, that will make Facebook more valuable to its users, which is kind of the whole point. I guess people expect offering APIs to be some sort of act of altruism.\",\n",

What is the underlying asset represented by ownership of property? It's the right to exclusively use some land and accompanying buildings. What is the underlying asset represented by stock? Leaving aside different kinds of stock, it's generally the right to receive a certain percentage of the profits of a company over time. Now, look at how price changes in the two assets are correlated with changes in the intrinsic value of the assets. A plot on the UES might appreciate 50% between 2000 and 2013, even though the neighborhood hasn't really changed in that time. The use and enjoyment a given person gets from that property is the same in 2000 and 2013. Now, compare to a stock. If the price of a stock appreciates 50% between 2000 and 2013, it's generally because the company has increased profits.

So when you say we can&#x27;t change it, it&#x27;s very true in one sense: if we vaporized the Mediterranean into the atmosphere, well before a month had gone by it&#x27;d have precipitated back to the liquid state on the Earth&#x27;s surface.<p>On the other hand, what you said could be misunderstood to mean that human activities have no effect on the average water vapor concentrations, and that&#x27;d be inaccurate. The equilibrium point is determined in large part by global temperatures: the higher they are, the more water vapor is pulled into the atmosphere. And we do have a mechanism to increase atmospheric temperatures: CO2.<p>CO2 by itself is fairly limited in terms of temperatures: doubling its atmospheric concentrations only increases average global temperatures by about a degree, which is simple to calculate and more or less undisputed. But what really kills us (and where uncertainties creep in) is in the positive feedback loops, the biggest of which is water vapor.

There are large companies pointlessly squatting on huge allocations; some of them assign <i>routable</i> IP addresses for every desktop in their network, despite (sanely) firewalling them off entirely from the Internet. A market for IP addresses would make that waste expensive and return potentially large numbers of addresses back to general use.<p>Second, the demand side: It will no doubt enrage HN nerds to hear this, but most Internet users do not need a first-class address. In fact, it\\'s possible that most Internet users are poorly-served by first-class addresses! They never take advantage of them, but holding them exposes them to attacks. Because mass-market application developers in 201x have to assume large portions of their users don\\'t have direct Internet connectivity, technology seems to be trending away from things that require it, and towards tunneling, HTTP-driven solutions, and third-party rendezvous.<p>Finally: Who says IPv6 needs to be the future? Bernstein\\'s summary[1] of the problems with transitioning is getting old, but the points in it seem valid. If we\\'re going to forklift a whole new collection of libraries and programs onto everyone\\'s computer, why don\\'t we just deprecate the whole IP layer and build something better. I don\\'t think I see the reason why IP can\\'t just be to 2020 what Ethernet was to 1990: a common connectivity layer we use to build better, more interesting network layers on top of.<p>The core functionality of the IP protocol has served beautifully over the last 20 years, but the frills and features have not. IP multicast is a failure. IPSEC is a failure. QOS is still a tool limited to network engineers. We barely have anycast.<p>These are all features that would be valuable if they work, but that don\\'t work because the end to end argument militates against them --- their service models evolve too fast for the infrastructure to keep up, and they\\'re pulled in different directions by different users anyways.<p>We can get new features <i>and</i> unbounded direct connectivity with overlay networks. We have only the most basic level of experience with overlays --- BitTorrent, Skype --- but the experience we\\'ve had seems to indicate that if you have a problem users care about, overlays tend to solve them nicely. We should start generalizing our experience with successful P2P systems like Skype and pull in some of the academic work (like the MIT PDOS RON project) and come up with a general-purpose connectivity layer that treats IPv4 like IPv4 treats Ethernet.<p>Special bonus to that strategy: Verizon and AT&#38;T don\\'t really get a say in how those overlays work, and nobody needs to wait for a standards committee to agree on whether things are going to be big endian or use ASN.1 or XML.<p>[1] <a href=\"http://cr.yp.to/djbdns/ipv6mess.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://cr.yp.to/djbdns/ipv6mess.html</a>',\n",
